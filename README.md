# Floxanne

Florent and Roxanne are some of the nices, kindest and funiest people I know.
And I am lucky to have them as my friends.

They are getting "registered" via civil union on the 24th of June 2022.
And I wanted to make sometime small but unique for them since they are all the way in Dallas and I suck and buying gifts.
